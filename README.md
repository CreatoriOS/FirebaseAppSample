# FirebaseAppSample

This is a SwiftUI code snippet for a login view. It contains a text field for the user's email, a secure field for the user's password, and a button to initiate the login process. When the button is tapped, the login() function is called, which uses Firebase Auth to sign in the user with the entered email and password. If there is an error with the sign in process, it will print the error's localized description. If the sign in is successful, it will print "success". The struct ContentView_Previews provides a preview of the ContentView.
